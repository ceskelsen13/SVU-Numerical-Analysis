## Newtons method


## Second Order Newton's method

""" 
# Inverse quadratic interpolation
By Jared McBride (2-20-2025, Buena Vista, VA)

This is an extension of the secant method method. But rather than using the secant line from two points it uses an arc from a sideways parabola, interpolated by three points. For more information see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_quadratic_interpolation)

Inputs:
f - the function whose root we seek
p0, p1, p2 - three initial points.
N - max number of iterations
tol - error tolerance

outputs:
p - the approximated roots
n - the number of iterations it took

## Example:
```
f = x -> cos(x) - x
p0 = .5
p1 = .6

p = QuadNewton(f, p0, p1).p
```
"""
function QuadNewton(f, p0, p1; 
    # Use secant to get a third point
    p2  = p0 - (p1 - p0) / (f(p1) - f(p0)) * f(p0),

    tol = 1e-10        # Defauls tolerance
